This is an archive of the Convergence 5 website, originally hosted on nola-goth.org (way back in 1999 when I still held the domain and ran that server).

It's unmodified from its immediate post-convention state, except:
- I've styled the table element to have a max width of 1024px and to be centered on the screen, to accommodate contemporary screen resolutions.
- I've removed links to nola-goth.org. The domain has been held by squatters since 2003, and I see no reason to direct further traffic/SEO their way.

Here's hoping this will provide nostalgia to folks who were around during that time and a bit of historical trivia to those who weren't.
