	<FONT face="arial,helvetica"> First, a little story. Seems that there's an
	old Cajun legend, passed<BR>
	down in their oral tradition, about werewolves. Another tradition of the
	Cajuns is warping the French language a bit to serve their purposes, and
	so the term for a French werewolf, "loup garou", becomes "rougarou" when
	translated into Acadian parlance.</FONT>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT face="arial,helvetica"> The rougaroux share a trait with vampires,
	that is, they suck the blood of mortals. Furthermore, it is claimed that
	only a witch can make a rougarou - either by turning themselves into wolves
	or cursing others with lycanthropy. In this way, three horrific folk monsters
	are combined into one.</FONT>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT face="arial,helvetica"> Now here's the best part - the rougaroux are
	known to gather for grand balls, to which they ride on the backs of bats.
	Just imagine a werewolves' masquerade ball! And then help us create it. Sing
	it with us now... "Ahwoooooo! Werewolves in N'awlins. Ahwooooooo!"</FONT>

      <FONT face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="Yellow">The last event of Convergence
      V was <B>The Rougaroux's Ball</B> - a bal masque in grand New Orleans tradition.
      &nbsp;Held on Sunday night, the ball featured gothic, industrial, eighties,
      and silly oddities (Vanilla Ice?!) courtesy of the excellent C5 DJs -
      <A HREF="music.html">Sexbat</A>, <A HREF="music.html">Lady Bathory</A>, and
      <A HREF="music.html">Fross</A> - who all definitely knew their crowd.

      <FONT face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="Yellow">A costume contest led by Caitlin
      R. Kiernan (author of SILK and THE DREAMING) afforded the exquisitely-dressed
      guests the opportunity to parade themselves around on stage and win stuff.
      &nbsp;Judges were DJ Lady Bathory, Cossack (of Goth Babe of the Week), Cusraque
      (of Boston's HELL, and CII organizer), and Trystan L. Bass (alt.gothic.fashion's
      FAQ mistress). &nbsp;Costume winners ran the gamut from victorian ladies
      to Boba Fett!</FONT>
