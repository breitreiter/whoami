		<FONT face="arial,helvetica"> Seraph Records' Falling Janus is a guitar based
		quartet out of New Orleans. &nbsp;In addition to conventional goth influences,

		and pornography.</FONT><BR>

		dance and make you think. They have opened for an impressive list of bands
		- including Alien Sex Fiend, Nine Inch Nails, and Covenant - and have recently
		attracted the attention of several record labels. Is their a signing in their
		future? Undoubtedly a band to watch. Cut.rate.box currently reside in New
		Orleans and released their fourth studio offering - the <I>BlueIceBlack EP</I>
		- right around Convergence V.</FONT><BR>

	    Mentallo &amp; The Fixer has been a prolific force in recent american industrial
	    music with over half a dozen full-length releases to date, as well as several
	    side projects. Initially known for anger filled, snarling distorted vocals,
	    hard cutting sequencer rhythms, and thunderous beats, they have shown tremendous
	    musical growth and artistic maturity in complex and emotional songs with
	    often dark, Gothic overtones. &nbsp;Mentallo &amp; The Fixer has recently
	    released the full length CD <I>Algorythum</I> on Metropolis. &nbsp;Convergence

	    such as Dead Can Dance, and most recently, in October of &#145;98, Xymox
	    co-headlined with the Cure at the Zillo Festival in Germany. Both legendary
	    and awe inspiring, Xymox was the largest act to ever play Convergence. &nbsp;As
