	  <FONT face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="Silver">Not technically an official night
	  o' C5, but many attendees chose to start things off by attending New Orleans'
	  regular goth/industrial club, The Crystal. &nbsp;The club brought in a variety
	  of special DJs spinning all weekend long, as well as the regulars we locals
	  know and &lt;ha&gt; love. Drinking, dancing, socializing and more than occasional
	  bawdiness lasted til sunup and started off C5 with the attitude to predominate
	  for many that weekend: drunkeness! :)</FONT>
