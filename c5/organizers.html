		<FONT face="arial,helvetica"> Heather Spear was the head honcho, great dictator,
		big cheese and chief whip-cracker of Convergence 5. &nbsp;She has organized
		many events both in New Orleans and her former hometown of Chicago, including
		the first ever Convergence and the annual
		<A HREF="#nola-goth.org/kdb/">Krewe du Boo</A> Gothic Mardi Gras
		Parade in New Orleans. Heather is still trying to figure out what possessed
		her to plan yet another Convergence. Temporary insanity, most likely. &nbsp;In
		her spare time, she enjoys rescuing bunches of orphaned kittens and decorating
		her bicycle, appropriately named "bike".</FONT>

		<A HREF="http://www.blood-dance.net/~nolagoth/">the New Orleans Gothic
		Guide</A>, a travel &amp; general dark city guide. In her spare time, Misha
		enjoys wearing things on her head and drinking Ace pear cider, often at the
